# Portfolio

## Description
A new revision of the first portfolio which has a lot of changes.

This version mainly uses express handlebars and express to show the page and the routes of the page. There are two main pages teh home page and the projects page. The home page is going to show information on myself, projects, and a resume. The project page is going to mainly use handlebars to change what it is showing for each project. 

I plan to use a database to store the project information so it can easliy be gathered and changed later. To use this I am goign to utilize sequelize to connect to the database.
